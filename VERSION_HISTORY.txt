The DomoPad Mobile Client Plugin has been updated to match the new identity and naming scheme of the DomoPad Android Client. One unfortunate side effect, like the native Android application, is that you will need to manually uninstall, or at least disable, the previous HousePad Android Client Plugin. Please disable the old plugin before installation of the new one or else the two may conflict, causing one or the other to fail to startup.
